## More about the project

I've built this project to showcase the skills i've learnt over the years working as a freelance designer who eventually had a change to get my hands on some coding. 
This project was built with Next.js and Sanity CMS. 
This project is deployed on Vercel servers and is ready to be viewed at [https://sanity-showcase-portfolio.vercel.app/]
